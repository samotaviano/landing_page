# Landing Page

This is an Udacity Front End Developer Nanodegree Project

## Assignment

It's creating a landing page made up of sections that are highlighted by DOM manipulation. Interactions are activated by scrolling and clicking on menu items. I also added a functionality to scroll the menu horizontally when the screen width is smaller than the total width of the menu. I created a page with the eight main planets of the solar system, so the user can see a picture and some information about the planet. Each planet resides in a section and the footer has some supplemental information.

## Components

> Main menu with scrolling arrows disposed when the screen is narrow.

> Planet sections with name, picture and info.

> Scroll top button.

> Footer with additional information and credits.

## Future improvements

> Activate the menu horizontal scroll along side the vertical scroll to highlight the menu item corresponding to the planet on screen.

> Add more info to the planets: Distance from the sun, One way light time to the sun, Length of the year, Planet type

> Refine menu scrolling with smooth animation.
